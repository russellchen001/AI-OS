## What this product is

AI-OS is a local-first personal AI operating system. The user says what they
want in plain language; AI-OS works out how to do it and gets it done.

Work is carried out by **Agents** — local executors that can actually touch the
computer, the internet, and connected services. Agents are the hands. The AI
models behind them, managed by AI Center, are the brain. Models are replaceable;
the product does not depend on any single provider.

Two capabilities are the reason this product exists, and neither is a chatbot
feature:

**AI Council（AI 智囊团）** — for any objective, a Chief of Staff works out which
models should be involved, assembles them into an advisory team, runs the
discussion, and produces a recommendation. Other products stop at the report.
Here the recommendation is meant to become work: the conclusion is handed to
Task Engine as a Do task, Planner turns it into steps, the user confirms, and an
Agent executes it. **Advice that turns into action is the differentiator.**

**AI Arena（AI 竞技场）** — multiple AIs interact under shared rules: debate,
social-deduction games such as Werewolf, collaboration, competition, role play,
simulation, or just talking to each other. Model comparison is one mode, not the
point. Arena is where the user watches AI behave, not where the user gets work
done.

Everything else in the roadmap exists to make these two possible and reliable.

## Agent roadmap

**v1.0 — OpenClaw only.**

OpenClaw is the single operational execution Agent for v1.0. Hermes and Custom
Agent records exist in the Registry but are non-operational placeholders. All
non-built-in agents are deletable; OpenClaw is built-in protected.

**v2.0 — Hermes leads, OpenClaw assists.**

The intended v2.0 arrangement, recorded now so the architecture does not close
it off:

- **Hermes** becomes the primary Agent. It is a growth-type agent — the more it
  is used, the better it understands the user. It owns continuity and judgement.
- **OpenClaw** becomes Hermes's assistant, used for what it is best at:
  connecting to and operating external systems and services.
- **WorkBuddy** and other agents may follow.

Design constraint this places on v1.0 work: the Runtime-to-Agent boundary must
stay a general adapter contract, not an OpenClaw-shaped one. Adding a second
Agent must not require changes to Task Engine, Planner, or Runtime.

---

## Open design gap — Council to execution

**Status: not yet specified. Decide before P16 implementation begins.**

AI Council currently ends at a recommendation. The path from recommendation to
executed work is undefined, which means P16 as specified would produce a
report-writing feature and the user would have to restate the plan manually to
get it done.

The required v1.0 path:

```text
AI Council
  ↓  recommendation
Task Engine        creates a Do task with the recommendation as context
  ↓
Planner            decomposes it into executable steps
  ↓
User confirmation  required — Council plans may include irreversible actions
  ↓
Runtime → OpenClaw executes
```

Things to settle when this is specified:

- Who converts a prose recommendation into a task objective — Council, Task
  Engine, or Planner
- What the confirmation surface looks like, and which step granularity the user
  approves
- Whether a Council plan can be saved and re-run later
- What happens when a step fails midway through a Council-originated plan

## In progress

P15 Core Skills remains active. File management is complete with real execution
and UI E2E evidence for `filesystem.scan`, `filesystem.read`,
`filesystem.write`, and `filesystem.move`.

All four capabilities enter through Task Engine and Planner, resolve through the
Skill registry, execute through Runtime and the dedicated `ai-os-files`
OpenClaw worker, enforce one-time confirmation where required, normalize real
tool results, and render readable Chat output without exposing raw Gateway
history.

---

## Next

Inventory the remaining P15 capability areas against the current repository and
choose the next implementation area based on existing maturity and dependencies:

1. Email and calendar
2. Browser and search
3. Downloads
4. NAS management
5. Document, spreadsheet, and presentation workflows
6. Local model management
7. Smart home and device control

Do not add phases or milestones unless explicitly added to the Master Guide.
Do not begin P16.

---

## Rejected — do not propose again

| Decision | Reason |
|---|---|
| Third-party Anthropic OAuth client | Anthropic publishes no public third-party client registration. Use the official `claude` CLI as a local authorization proxy instead. |
| Reading or persisting Claude Code's OAuth token | Claude Code owns its own credential. AI-OS stores only the local connection and model preference. |
| Consumer Meta AI login for third-party inference | Not authorized by Meta. Only the Meta Model API developer key is supported. |
| Top-right `Add AI` button | Duplicated the `Other AI` catalog entry. The catalog entry is the single generic Provider path. |
| Treating every Ollama model-discovery failure as "no models installed" | Misleading. The card now distinguishes not-installed, stopped, starting, running-without-models, and ready. |
| Auto fallback after output has started | Fallback only fires when a candidate fails *before* producing output. Explicit model selection never silently switches. |
| Hard-coding one game into Arena architecture | Werewolf and similar are representative cases, not the architecture. |

---

## Technical decisions

**AI Center**

- Shared Multi-Model Invocation is the canonical execution layer
- Each participant owns an independent `operationId`
- Multi-model execution is fully concurrent; participants never use Auto fallback
- Participant ordering is deterministic after normalization; duplicates removed pre-execution
- Aggregated results preserve per-model P13-M4 metadata
- Auto routing is Local First: local Ollama models are attempted before connected cloud defaults
- Explicit manual model selection never silently falls back
- Fallback occurs only before output has started
- Cancellation stops the current stream without later output continuation

**Memory**

- Ordinary Chat requests load long-term `user` memories and inject them as outbound message zero
- Memory Policy is separate from Memory Storage; `src/services/memoryPolicy.ts` owns parsing, resolution, and outbound constraints while SQLite CRUD remains unchanged
- ChatPage only retrieves Memory, calls the Memory Policy resolver, and assembles outbound context; it does not own concrete Policy rules
- Policy priority is current request override, then long-term Memory, then system default
- Resolved runtime policy enters only the outbound request and is also applied to a temporary clone of the current outbound user message for model compatibility
- UI and saved conversation user content always retain the original text; request overrides are never written into conversation history or long-term Memory and do not affect the next request
- Ordinary factual memories remain available as background context without forced structured parsing
- Explicit “记住…” commands remain a local save-and-confirm path and do not call AI Center
- Initial structured policies are `language`, `response_detail`, `currency`, and `budget`
- Conversation-scoped persistent overrides are not implemented
- Streaming Provider input accepts `system` messages; Anthropic combines them into the Messages API top-level `system` field and excludes them from `messages`

**P15 Core Skills**

- Explicit Core Skill actions enter through Task Engine and Planner, resolve through the existing Skill registry, and execute through Runtime and OpenClaw
- One-time user confirmation is PlanStep-scoped and permits only the exact implemented `filesystem.scan`, `filesystem.read`, `filesystem.write`, and `filesystem.move` actions; it does not modify trusted automation
- Work/Core Skill errors use safe OpenClaw/Runtime reporting, while ASK errors retain AI Center/provider semantics
- `filesystem.scan` is an AI-OS capability identifier, not an OpenClaw Gateway RPC or tool id; the adapter translates it to the official `agent` / `agent.wait` path and reads the resulting session history
- Real `filesystem.scan` E2E passed through Task, Planner, Runtime, permission, OpenClaw agent, read-only `exec`, normalized output, and Chat UI on 2026-08-15
- `filesystem.read` always requires one-time confirmation, uses the same dedicated worker, detects MIME and size before reading, never sends unsupported binary content to Chat, and bounds text reads to 1 MB with at most 64 KiB returned
- `filesystem.write` always requires one-time confirmation, passes selected path and current text through the existing Plan/Runtime chain, limits UTF-8 content to 4 KiB, creates with 0600 permissions, and uses shell noclobber plus an existence check so overwrite attempts fail closed
- Real `filesystem.write` E2E passed through Task, Planner, Runtime, permission, OpenClaw agent, `exec`, normalized output, and Chat UI on 2026-08-15; the UI-created file contained the exact 27-byte requested text
- `filesystem.move` always requires one-time confirmation, requires absolute and different source/destination paths, forbids overwrite, verifies the source disappears and destination appears after `mv`, and reports source-missing, destination-existing, or execution failure without claiming success
- Real `filesystem.move` E2E passed through Task, Planner, Runtime, permission, OpenClaw agent, `exec`, normalized output, and Chat UI on 2026-08-15
- File execution uses the dedicated `ai-os-files` OpenClaw worker with no inherited skills or workspace bootstrap context and an isolated Ollama provider; `main` remains the default personal agent
- OpenClaw permission and confirmation remain authoritative; the dedicated worker does not enable trusted automation or bypass tool policy

**Migration**

- Legacy MultiLLM service has been removed
- Provider Registry is the single source of provider identity
- Council and My AI consume AI Center provider models
- No new feature should introduce MultiLLM-specific storage keys or execution paths

**Removing legacy code**

- CSS class names have no compile-time link to TypeScript, so deleting a
  feature can silently remove styles the surviving UI still uses; the build
  will still pass
- When removing a module, grep `App.css` for its class names before and after
  and confirm every affected screen renders

**Credentials**

- All API keys and OAuth tokens pass to the native security layer and live in macOS Keychain
- A newly stored credential is removed automatically if live verification fails
- Claude Code subscription execution stays routed separately from Anthropic API-key execution

**Observability**

- AI Center owns the canonical invocation record; Workspace renders it but must
  not reconstruct routing decisions
- Records include route mode, execution source, latency, ordered attempts, and fallback state
- Records exclude prompts, outputs, raw Provider responses, credentials, and tokens

## Decided — 2026-08-02

**AI Center routing moves to the Rust backend.**

Provider invocation, Auto ordering, fallback selection, and credential use
belong in Rust. The frontend submits a request and renders the result. It must
not select providers, order candidates, decide fallback, or hold credentials in
memory.

Rationale: background and scheduled execution cannot depend on an open
application window; credentials must stay in the native security layer;
Runtime, Memory (P14), AI Council (P16), and AI Arena (P17) all need backend
access to AI Center.

Migration is incremental, not a rewrite. Each step ships its own acceptance
script and must not change observable behaviour:

This is architectural correction, not a P13 milestone. P13 is defined by the
Master Guide as M1-M5 and is complete. These steps are tracked as AC-BACKEND,
outside the phase numbering.

Provider HTTP invocation already moved to Rust as part of the legacy MultiLLM
removal (AC-BACKEND-0).

1. **AC-BACKEND-1 — Completed.** Rust owns Auto ordering, Local First
   preference, and fallback selection. The frontend sends an Auto-or-manual
   request and renders the selected result. Observability remains in the
   frontend until AC-BACKEND-2.
2. **AC-BACKEND-2 — Completed.** Rust supplies canonical route mode, source,
   ordered attempts, outcomes, safe error categories, latency, token estimates,
   and fallback state. The frontend is a call-and-render layer that enriches
   pricing from the existing `modelPricing` configuration and persists
   Analytics to localStorage. Invocation records exclude prompt, output,
   credential, API key, OAuth token, access token, and refresh token contents.
   Multi-model concurrency, explicit choices, deterministic ordering, and
   per-participant operation IDs remain unchanged.

Constraints carried into the migration:

- Local First ordering, per-participant `operationId`, concurrent multi-model
  execution, and no-fallback-for-multi-model all survive unchanged
- Claude Code subscription execution stays routed separately from Anthropic
  API-key execution
- Fallback still fires only before output has started
- Invocation records still exclude prompts, outputs, credentials, and tokens

## External Skill Architecture

### Agency Agents Skill Reference

Repository:
https://github.com/msitarzewski/agency-agents

Purpose:
- Use external Agent Skill packages to provide professional role definitions for AI Council.
- AI-OS should not maintain a duplicate internal agent talent library.
- Agent roles, expertise descriptions and workflow templates should come from installable Skills.
- Preserve Agency Agents as a candidate source and design reference for the P16
  AI Council expert Profile/Role Library and dynamic expert-team assembly.
- Do not integrate Agency Agents during P15 unless the Master Guide roadmap is
  explicitly revised.

Architecture direction:

AI-OS owns:
- Skill discovery
- Skill loading
- Role selection
- Council orchestration
- Memory tracking
- Model assignment

Skills own:
- Agent role definitions
- Professional personas
- Expertise descriptions
- Workflow instructions
- Output standards

Initial reference Skill:
- Agency Agents

Important boundary:
- Agency Agents is a Skill resource, not a Runtime.
- Before P16 implementation begins, specify the full Council-to-execution
  contract: Council recommendation → Task Engine → Planner → user confirmation
  → Runtime → OpenClaw.
- AI-OS v1.0 execution remains OpenClaw-only.
- External Agent Skills provide Council roles only and do not introduce additional execution adapters.

Future Skill model:

## External Orchestration Architecture Reference

### Paperclip Reference

Repository:
https://github.com/paperclipai/paperclip

Local reference checkout:
- `../paperclip`
- Reference commit when recorded: `f0e6c0f54`

Purpose:
- Preserve Paperclip as an external architecture and implementation reference
  for AI-OS task orchestration and execution governance.
- Study its goal hierarchy, task lifecycle, delegation, approvals, budget
  controls, heartbeat scheduling, audit trail, persistent execution state, and
  runtime adapter boundaries before P16 implementation begins.
- Use Paperclip to inform the unresolved Council-to-execution contract rather
  than introducing a second AI-OS orchestration system.
- Do not integrate or run Paperclip as part of P15 Core Skills.
- Do not make Paperclip an AI-OS Runtime or execution Agent.

Architecture boundary:

AI-OS owns:
- AI Council
- Task Engine
- Planner
- User confirmation and approvals
- Runtime policy
- Memory
- AI Center
- OpenClaw execution integration

Paperclip is reference material for:
- Goal-to-task decomposition patterns
- Task ownership and delegation
- Approval and governance flows
- Budget and execution limits
- Heartbeat / resumable work patterns
- Persistent task state
- Audit and observability patterns
- Runtime adapter separation

Important boundary:
- Paperclip is an orchestration reference, not a dependency decision.
- AI-OS must not duplicate Paperclip wholesale or introduce its runtime model
  without an explicit architecture decision.
- AI-OS v1.0 execution remains OpenClaw-only.
- Paperclip support for other agent runtimes does not expand the AI-OS v1.0
  Agent scope.
- Before P16 coding begins, compare the Paperclip reference against the required
  AI-OS contract:
  Council recommendation → Task Engine → Planner → user confirmation
  → Runtime → OpenClaw.
- Adopt only mechanisms that fit the AI-OS architecture and Master Guide.

### Local external reference repositories

These repositories are intentionally kept outside the `dashboard` repository
and must not be committed into the AI-OS application source tree:

- `../agency-agents` — Agency Agents role/Profile reference, commit `ebe9c99`
- `../paperclip` — orchestration architecture reference, commit `f0e6c0f54`

They are source references only. P15 must not depend on either repository at
runtime.
