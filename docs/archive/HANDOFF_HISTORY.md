### Connected AI providers

| Provider | Method | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Google Gemini | Native PKCE OAuth | Verified — 50 models |
| OpenAI Codex / ChatGPT | Official Codex OAuth, port 1455 | Verified — 7 models, GPT-5.6-Sol |
| xAI Grok | RFC 8628 device auth + API key | Verified — grok-4.5 |
| Anthropic Claude Code | Official `claude` CLI as local proxy | Verified — Claude Pro |
| Ollama (local) | Local runtime | Verified — qwen2.5:7b, qwen3:8b, deepseek-r1:8b |
| DeepSeek | API key | Implemented, key not yet entered |
| OpenRouter | PKCE + API key | Implemented, no account yet |
| Kimi Code | RFC 8628 device auth | Implemented, no account yet |
| Meta Model API | Developer key | Implemented, no account yet |

Credentials are stored in macOS Keychain only. Never in browser state, Provider
config, or the repository.

## In progress

Nothing is mid-implementation. The working tree contains only acceptance
tooling (`verify_all.sh`, `done.sh`, `context.sh`, `verify/`), which is not yet
committed.

---

## Next

1. Commit the acceptance tooling (`verify_all.sh`, `done.sh`, `context.sh`, `verify/`)
2. Manual end-to-end QA: Auto route, manual route, multi-model, streaming,
   cancellation, fallback, analytics
3. Fix anything QA finds
4. **P13-M6a** — begin the AI Center backend migration (see Decided below)
5. P14 Memory, after the migration lands

---

## Rejected — do not propose again

| Decision | Reason |
|---|---|
| Third-party Anthropic OAuth client | Anthropic publishes no public third-party client registration. Use the official `claude` CLI as a local authorization proxy instead. |
| Reading or persisting Claude Code's OAuth token | Claude Code owns its own credential. AI-OS stores only the local connection and model preference. |
| Consumer Meta AI login for third-party inference | Not authorized by Meta. Only the Meta Model API developer key is supported. |
| Top-right `Add AI` button | Duplicated the `Other AI` catalog entry. The catalog entry is the single generic Provider path. |
| Treating every Ollama model-discovery failure as "no models installed" | Misleading. The card now distinguishes not-installed, stopped, starting, running-without-models, and ready. |
| Auto fallback after output has started | Fallback only fires when a candidate fails *before* producing output. Explicit model selection never silently switches. |
| Hard-coding one game into Arena architecture | Werewolf and similar are representative cases, not the architecture. |

## Technical decisions

**AI Center**

- Shared Multi-Model Invocation is the canonical execution layer
- Each participant owns an independent `operationId`
- Multi-model execution is fully concurrent; participants never use Auto fallback
- Participant ordering is deterministic after normalization; duplicates removed pre-execution
- Aggregated results preserve per-model P13-M4 metadata
- Auto routing is Local First: local Ollama models are attempted before connected cloud defaults

**Credentials**

- All API keys and OAuth tokens pass to the native security layer and live in macOS Keychain
- A newly stored credential is removed automatically if live verification fails
- Claude Code subscription execution stays routed separately from Anthropic API-key execution

**Observability**

- AI Center owns the canonical invocation record; Workspace renders it but must
  not reconstruct routing decisions
- Records exclude prompts, outputs, raw Provider responses, credentials, and tokens

---

## Decided — 2026-08-02

**AI Center routing moves to the Rust backend.**

Provider invocation, Auto ordering, fallback selection, and credential use
belong in Rust. The frontend submits a request and renders the result. It must
not select providers, order candidates, decide fallback, or hold credentials in
memory.

Rationale: background and scheduled execution cannot depend on an open
application window; credentials must stay in the native security layer;
Runtime, Memory (P14), AI Council (P16), and AI Arena (P17) all need backend
access to AI Center.

Migration is incremental, not a rewrite. Each step ships its own acceptance
script and must not change observable behaviour:

1. **P13-M6a** — move provider HTTP invocation into Rust. The frontend still
   decides which provider and model; it just stops making the call itself.
2. **P13-M6b** — move Auto ordering, Local First preference, and fallback
   selection into Rust. The frontend sends the request and an Auto-or-manual
   flag.
3. **P13-M6c** — reduce `src/services/aiCenter.ts` to a thin call-and-render
   layer. Observability records are produced in Rust and passed up.

Constraints carried into the migration:

- Local First ordering, per-participant `operationId`, concurrent multi-model
  execution, and no-fallback-for-multi-model all survive unchanged
- Claude Code subscription execution stays routed separately from Anthropic
  API-key execution
- Fallback still fires only before output has started
- Invocation records still exclude prompts, outputs, credentials, and tokens

## Environment notes

- Repository is a Tauri app: Rust backend in `src-tauri/`, React/TypeScript frontend in `src/`
- Latest full validation: 394 Rust tests passing, `cargo check` passing with 4 pre-existing warnings, frontend production build passing
- Owner's machine is macOS; do not hard-code absolute user paths in this file
